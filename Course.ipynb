Top-down will put you in the driver seat of an f1 car were you learn what research/production machine learning workflows are and how they can be applied to solve business problems. The bottom-up approach will start you off at the bare essentials and teach all the separate pieces of the puzzle that will fit together. \n",

        "The later approach is how most education systems are structured and the main reason why I did not got back to Univeristy. There are more efficient ways of learning and implementing a skill I feel. However, I delibrartely put the bottom-up approach here for those who have no idea what programming is and need a safe position to start from and also for those who want to brush up on the fundamentals or figure out a specific library writes its Python functions in a similar way.\n",
