Lets get you up and running with your data science quest

My main goal is to get you up with data science for free and balancing your leaning with different resources. Most importantly it can be pricey to learn data science, pcs, clouyd monies, etc. this is not fair but i come to you with a way. 



How to go through courses?

There are two ways you can do this all depending on your prefernce of the top-Down approach or bottom-up approach. Top-down will put you in the driver seat of an f1 car were you learn what research/production machine learning workflows are and how they can be applied to solve business problems. The bottom-up approach will start you off at the bare essentials and teach all the separate pieces of the puzzle that will fit together. 

The later approach is how most education systems are structured and the main reason why I did not got back to Univeristy. There are more efficient ways of learning and implementing a skill I feel. However, I delibrartely put the bottom-up approach here for those who have no idea what programming is and need a safe position to start from and also for those who want to brush up on the fundamentals or figure out a specific library writes its Python functions in a similar way.

Internet connection & browser. 

You need documenrt and do a lot of your own work. Make sure you apply what you have learnt to use cases other than what you have learnt. Eventually you will have an extensive portfolio to track tangiable progress. 

Determine your skill level

Once you have deterimend where you lie on this table I will show you where and what you should be doing. However, if you feel that you can start somewhere specific then please go ahead and then go back to course that you need that will plug up your knowledge.
