## Why?
Data Science is using data to understand events and teach computers to recognize patterns the same way our brains do.

It is nice and broad that you get different fields that you specialize in. 

Data analyst: Responbile for gathering insights from large datasets to do reporting and business intellengce. Typical questions they would need to answer are : find second highest salary of an Employee. Lots of extracting data from different database types, data warehousing/ETL if necessary

Data Engineer: 

ML Engineer


## How?

Either read the medium article or run the notebook on google colab or read the markdown file!


## When?
The duration is based on your consisty in being able to understand/implement/document your work. Courses come with their own recommended completion time, you need to make sure you can do it in that time and budget for the time it will take for you reimplement what you've learnt to your own problem and document the results. 

For most this can take a week, several days a month based on your avaiable skills, time and responsibilities. However you need to aim for a full years worth of tackling this to get grips with creating reproducable work! 

Ultimately you need to have at least 5 experiments within a few months you have completed that you can form an opinon on and provide how your work is valid and its short commings.
