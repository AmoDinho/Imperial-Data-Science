# Workspace Setup ðŸ“¡

Below are suggested workflows on how to complete the courses and tips on how to set up your environment. 

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Google has an equally great cloud offering that can be used for a wide variety use cases. 

However, Google offers [Colabortory](https://colab.research.google.com/) . Which is an online Juypter notebook that is powered by a Tesla K80 GPU. You can install all your favourite libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras etc.

For a more traditional Approach you could used GCP's [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing#gpus), choose an instance type and attach a GPU to your instance. This is a bit more administrative and I would not recommend it if you are just starting out. 

[TPU](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/)
Google has built Tensor Processing Units designed for computational demanding workloads. When getting started this sort of setup is not necessary. However, it is great to know about because somewhere down the line you need an environment like this.

[ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/getting-started-training-prediction)

ML engine allows teams to train and deploy their models via the service. It also deploys your model with serverless hosting and can scale with TBs of data. You can also import models that have been trained on another service.

[Cloud Deep Learning VM Image (Beta)](https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm-image/)

A deep learning virtual machine is preconfigured with all the necessary ML frameworks. You can also add Cloud TPU nad GPU support!

## Azure

[Data Science Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/)

Azure's pre-configured VMs are perfect for data sciensits! They come packed with all the tools you need like Anaconda, deep learning tools like TensorFlow, it has data platform and visualization tools like Spark, SQL Server, PowerBI and many more! You can choose between a Windows or Linux machine. Obvisouly if you're just doing basic ML experiments or Deep Learning projects you need configure the machine according to your needs.
