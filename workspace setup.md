# Workspace Setup

Below are suggested workflows on how to complete the courses and tips on how to set up your environment. 

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Google has an equally great cloud offering that can be used for a wide variety use cases. 

However, Google offers [Colabortory](https://colab.research.google.com/) . Which is an online Juypter notebook that is powered by a Tesla K80 GPU. You can install all your favourite libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras etc.

For a more traditional Approach you could used GCP's [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing#gpus), choose an instance type and attach a GPU to your instance. This is a bit more administrative and I would not recommend it if you are just starting out.
